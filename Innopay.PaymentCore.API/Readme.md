I can help you create a simple domain model and database schema for this banking system that uses CQRS. Below is an outline of how to structure it.

Domain Model
1. PaymentRequest (Aggregate Root - Write Model)
Represents a payment request submitted through the system.
Properties:
PaymentRequestId (GUID): Unique identifier for the payment request.
Amount (Decimal): The amount to be paid.
Currency (string): The currency of the payment (e.g., USD, EUR).
Status (enum): Payment status (Pending, Completed, Failed).
PayerId (GUID): The identifier of the person making the payment.
PayeeId (GUID): The identifier of the person receiving the payment.
CreatedAt (DateTime): The timestamp when the payment request was created.
UpdatedAt (DateTime): The timestamp when the payment request was last updated.
2. PaymentStatus (Read Model - Materialized View)
Represents the current status of a payment request that users query.
Properties:
PaymentRequestId (GUID): The unique identifier of the payment request.
Status (string): The current status of the payment.
ProcessedAt (DateTime): The time when the payment status was last updated.
API Commands (Write Operations)
SubmitPaymentRequest: Accepts a payment request and stores it in the write database.
UpdatePaymentStatus: Changes the status of a payment (e.g., from Pending to Completed).
API Queries (Read Operations)
GetPaymentStatus: Retrieves the current status of a payment request by querying the materialized view.
Database Schema
Write Database Schema (For Command/Write Operations)
Table: PaymentRequests
PaymentRequestId: UniqueIdentifier (Primary Key)
Amount: Decimal
Currency: NVARCHAR(3)
Status: NVARCHAR(20)
PayerId: UniqueIdentifier
PayeeId: UniqueIdentifier
CreatedAt: DateTime
UpdatedAt: DateTime
Read Database Schema (For Query Operations)
Table: PaymentStatusView
PaymentRequestId: UniqueIdentifier (Primary Key)
Status: NVARCHAR(20)
ProcessedAt: DateTime
Example Process Flow
Submit Payment Request (Command):

API receives a new payment request and writes it to the PaymentRequests table.
Update Payment Status (Command):

When a payment status changes, it updates the status in the PaymentRequests table and triggers an event to update the PaymentStatusView.
Query Payment Status (Query):

The user can query the PaymentStatusView to check the status of their payment.
This should give you a clear structure for building the CQRS system in your demo. You can implement these concepts in C# using Entity Framework or any other ORM to handle the database interaction and API logic.
